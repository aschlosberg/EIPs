## Abstract

We describe a mechanism for which, upon transfer of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), the dominant strategy of the new owner is to truthfully reveal if the owning entity has changed and, if so, report their valuation of the token and pay a creator-specified royalty based on said valuation.

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

While [ERC-2981](./eip-2981.md) introduced a standard for contracts to signal a royalty amount to be paid to the creator upon sale of an NFT, it doesn't describe a means of enforcement.
It goes so far as to state that "payment must be voluntary, as transfer mechanismsâ€¦ \[do\] not always imply a sale occurred".

The problem with on-chain enforcement stems from the fact that the information available to any enforcement contracts is incomplete.
So, upon token transfer, contracts are unaware of the nature of the transfer (e.g. sale, private, gift, etc.) or any corresponding flow of funds (e.g. sales price), which are commonly needed to compute the amount of funds that has to be paid to the creator.
Contracts therefore have to rely on external parties to supply this information which can either be gamed if the involved parties are dishonest or introduce centralisation.
This problem is aggravated in OTC deals, where the flow of funds can be handled entirely via separate channels that are unknown or intransparent to any third party.

On-chain royalty enforcement can still be feasible in practice though by creating a sufficiently strong incentive or penalty to force participating parties to provide honest information.
To also account for OTC deals, we devise a mechanism that targets the primary actors in a transfer (i.e. the previous and new token owner) as parties to supply the information required for enforcement, and forces them to reveal it truthfully.

  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

For each `tokenId` we introduce a set of addresses whose members MAY transfer the token to themselves without payment by calling `TBD()`, which we will refer to as *take-back*.
The set MUST be initially empty.
For every [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) transfer, *except* for initial mint, the set of the corresponding `tokenId` MUST be appended with the previous owner (i.e. the transfer's `from` address).

Royalty payment by the token owner MUST be accepted by the token contract via a dedicated function, `TBD()`.
Upon receipt of royalties, the take-back set MUST be emptied (i.e. transfer permissions collapse back to standard ERC-721 rules).
After each token transfer, there SHOULD be a grace period during which the token is frozen and take-backs are disabled to allow the new owner to decide whether to pay the royalty or allow the take-back set to grow.

In addition to clearing the take-back set, receipt of royalties MUST begin a temporary window during which *any* address MAY purchase the token for a price that is a function of the royalty received (which can be viewed as the inverse of the `royaltyInfo()` function of ERC-2981).
This process is referred to as *auto-listing* and is not limited to addresses in the take-back set.
The token MUST NOT be transferrable for the duration of the *auto-listing*.
Implementations MAY specify the duration of the auto-listing window at their discretion but it MUST be finite and SHOULD be long enough to allow arbitrage opportunities to be detected and, after expiration, transfer permissions MUST collapse back to standard ERC-721 rules.

}

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD 

TODO: a yellow paper with proofs of strategy dominance will be included in the assets; this is being finalised.

Summary rationale for the draft:
The risk of take-back in the event of no royalty being paid is only a rational decision if the same entity controls both addresses; i.e. a change in beneficial owner of the token results in a royalty payment but transfer between one's own addresses doesn't require one.
The auto-listing window ensures *truthful* revelation of the value of the token.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

Needs discussion.
